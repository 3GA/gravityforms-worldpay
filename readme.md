# Gravity forms Worldpay gateway

This was a client project that we're open sourcing. It has limited functionality, but you can hook up your worldpay account and start collecting money through Gravity Forms.

It only supports one-off fees, and there are a few limitations on the code base. I've modeled it after the authorize.net gateway
